# Statify — Spotify stats template 📊

A small app for spotify that (for now) can fetch tracks,artists and stats by using Spotify's web API.
This is my First project as an absolute beginner in python so expect nothing.

Status
- I am still working on it. I want to implement CustomTkinter in the app. the app barely works with CustomTkinter so just remove that part if you want to see what i did

Statify
- authenticate with Spotify get tracks,albums and artists  
- CustomTkinter GUI
- .env example requirements short README.

Getting started
1. Create a Spotify developer app and set a Redirect URL (It can be anything local (or not) except localhost). 🛠️   
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your client id and client secret.  
3. Install dependencies:
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
4. done

Configuration (.env) (get all of these on https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
- CLIENT_ID — your Spotify Client ID  
- CLIENT_SECRET — your Spotify Client Secret
-
