# Spotistats — Spotify stats template 🎧📊

A small app for spotify that (for now) can fetch tracks,artists and stats by using Spotify's web API.
This is my First project as an absolute beginner in python so expect nothing.

Status
- I am still working on it. I want to implement CustomTkinter in the app. the app barely works with CustomTkinter so just remove that part if you want to see what i did

Statify
- Lightweight example to authenticate with Spotify and fetch tracks,albums and artists. 🔌  
- Optional CustomTkinter GUI placeholder to display results in a window (doesnt work yet). 🪟  
- .env example, requirements, and a short README. 📁

Features (placeholders)
- animated dashes (-) and text in effects.py made entirely by ChatGPT
- Spotify OAuth 🔑  
- Fetch top tracks and top artists and top albums 🎶
- little bit of broken CustomTkinter 📈

Getting started
1. Create a Spotify developer app and set a Redirect URL (It can be anything local (or not) except localhost). 🛠️   
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your client id and client secret.  
3. Install dependencies:
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
4. done

Quick run (CLI)
- python main.py

Quick run (GUI placeholder)
- python gui.py

Configuration (.env) (get all of these on https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
- CLIENT_ID — your Spotify Client ID  
- CLIENT_SECRET — your Spotify Client Secret  

Notes
- This repo is a starting point.

License
- Add a license file when ready.
